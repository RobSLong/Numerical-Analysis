# Numerical-Analysis

This repository contains projects focused around Numerical Analysis and each directory is intended to be a self-contained project with adequate enough documentation to be used as educational content. My academic background and research experience is in fluid dynamics (specifically convection - buoyancy driven flows relevant to all aspects of natural and industrial fluid flows) and most of the problems here are relevant to principles in fluid dynamics.

Each directory herein contains a self-contained project with the naming convention \<**application-method**\> e.g. DiffusionEq-FiniteDifferences is a project which describes how to solve the diffusion equation using the finite difference numerical scheme. The \<readme\> in each directory should provide enough information to understand the problem and provide a foundation for similar projects to be undertaken!

## Projects include
* #### Advection
solving the linear advection equation in 1D and analysing how the error reduces with computing time
* solving the diffusion equation in both 1D and 2D with different data visualisation methods presented
* simulating thermal convection using the Navier Stokes equations in 2D and how to verify and validate numerical solutions
