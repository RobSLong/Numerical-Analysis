# Numerical-Analysis

This repository contains projects linked to Numerical Analysis and each directory contains an individual project with the naming convention <application-nmethod> a.g. DiffusionEq-FiniteDifferences is a project which describes how to solve the diffusion equation using the finite difference numerical scheme.
  
Each project contains a readme file which is aimed to contain enough information to act as a standalone educational document to understand the problem and provide a foundation for similar projects to be undertaken!

Projects include
solving the linear advection equation in 1D and analysing how the error reduces with computing time
solving the diffusion equation in both 1D and 2D with different data visualisation methods presented
simulating thermal convection using the Navier Stokes equations in 2D and how to verify and validate numerical solutions
