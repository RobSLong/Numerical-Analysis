$$\dfrac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}c = \nu \nabla^2 c$$
In 1D the flow has one component, $u$, and only one spatial coordinate is considered, $x$, which we will often refer to as the channel axis - 
$$\dfrac{\partial c}{\partial t} + u \dfrac{\partial c}{\partial x} = \nu \dfrac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}$$

Assum the mass of pollutant, $m=1$ kg/s, the flow velocity, $u=1$ m/s, standard deviation, $\sigma=0.25$ m and the diffusivity, $\nu = 0.02$ m$^2$/s. The initial distribution of pollutant concentration rtravels along the channel axis due to advection by the channel's constant flow speed  and simulateously smoothed as time goes by due to diffusion.
