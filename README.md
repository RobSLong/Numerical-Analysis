# Numerical-Analysis

This repository contains projects focused around Numerical Analysis and each directory is intended to be a self-contained project with adequate enough documentation to be used as educational content. My academic background and research experience is in fluid dynamics (specifically convection - buoyancy driven flows relevant to all aspects of natural and industrial fluid flows) and most of the problems here are relevant to principles in fluid dynamics.

Each directory herein contains a self-contained project with the naming convention \<**application-method**\> e.g. DiffusionEq-FiniteDifferences is a project which describes how to solve the diffusion equation using the finite difference numerical scheme. The \<readme\> in each directory should provide enough information to understand the problem and provide a foundation for similar projects to be undertaken!

## Projects Highlights
 #### Advection
 This project outlines how to numerically solve the linear advection equation,
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+v \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0.$$
 in 1D using both explicit and implicit finite difference formulations. We present an analysis of how the error scales with the computing time and suggest a method for **optimising** the numerical scheme to most efficiently reach a specified level of accuracy.
